/* This story was inspired by: The Stanley Parable
fyi the story was meant to be only include one character but since the rubric requires 2 names, I 
have no choice but to include 2 charcters despite it having almost no impact to the story whatsoever

the narrator in this story dictates almost everything the characters do but the characters sometimes disobeys the narrator
anything they personally do is marked by brackets

sometimes the story crashes for absolutely no reason especially when wrap output in on
\n is hard coded in every line so you should be able to read it without having wrap output on unless you use long names*/
